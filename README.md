Objective
The project aims to analyze and predict Electric Vehicle (EV) sales across different states in India using a dataset containing sales data. By applying data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and machine learning models, the project seeks to uncover patterns in EV sales and evaluate the predictive performance of two regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
